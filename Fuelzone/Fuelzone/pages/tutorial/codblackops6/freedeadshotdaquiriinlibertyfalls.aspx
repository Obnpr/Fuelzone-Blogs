                    <p>
                        The Black Ops 6 Zombies Deadshot Daiquiri usually takes a while to unlock, but there’s a way you can get it within minutes. Deadshot Daiquiri is a perk that increases enemy critical damage. As well as that, aiming down sights snaps to an enemy’s critical point.

                        While you can find it on the Terminus map, it’s not available on Liberty Falls. That is, unless you do this one easy trick. So, here’s how to get the Deadshot Daiquiri.

                    <h5>Step-by-Step Guide to Unlock Deadshot Daiquiri</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Head to Liberty Falls:</strong> This trick works solo, but it’s easier if you’re in a squad. Once you spawn in, shoot enemies until you accumulate 2000 points. It won’t take long.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Go to the Motor Lodge Motel Roof:</strong> With your 2000 points, head to the roof just behind the Motor Lodge Motel and purchase the sniper rifle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Head to the Cemetery:</strong> With the sniper rifle in hand, head to the cemetery. The cemetery is located to the north of the map, to the right of the church.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Find the Gap in the Fence:</strong> Look for the opening to the cemetery, which is a gap in the fence. Aim with your sniper rifle and you’ll see five cans lined up on the distant fence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Shoot the Cans:</strong> Shoot these five cans, and you’ll be rewarded with a free Deadshot Daiquiri.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Tips for Success</h5>
                    <p>
                        Enemies will be attacking you as you do this, which is why it’s easier to pull this off when you’re in a squad. One player can hold off the zombies while another shoots the cans, or vice versa. Additionally, be mindful that your sniper rifle only has five bullets, and there are five cans, meaning you have to hit a can with every bullet. If you miss, the cans will disappear, but they will respawn after a few minutes so you can try again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, that’s how you unlock the Deadshot Daiquiri on Liberty Falls! Good luck, and happy hunting!
